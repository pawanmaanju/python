# Printing "Hello World" to the console
print("Hello World")  # print is a built-in function that outputs text

# Declaring a variable in Python
a = "pawan"  # Python automatically detects the data type (in this case, a string)

# Taking input from the user
Name = input("Enter The Name : ")  # By default, input is read as a string

# Changing the input type to integer
age = int(input("Enter The Age : "))  # The input is converted to an integer using int()

# Output the values
print("Your Name is : ", Name)  # Display the user's name
print("Your Age Is : ", age)  # Display the user's age

Key points:
	1.	print() is used to display text.
	2.	Variables in Python do not require explicit type declaration. The type is inferred automatically.
	3.	input() takes user input as a string by default. To convert it to another type, use int() for integers, float() for decimals, etc.
