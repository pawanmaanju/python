# For loop that iterates 4 times but does nothing in each iteration
for i in range(4):
    pass  # The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes

# While loop that prints the value of i and increments it until i is no longer less than 45
while i < 45:
    print(i)  # Print the current value of i
    i += 1  # Increment i by 1
