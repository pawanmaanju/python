                            #Explanation:

"""
	1.	A = 10: This assigns the value 10 to the variable A, which is of the integer data type.
	2.	B = 11.1: This assigns the value 11.1 to the variable B, which is of the floating-point data type (decimal number).
	3.	C = "PAWAN": This assigns the string "PAWAN" to the variable C, making it a string (text data type).
	4.	D = False: This assigns the boolean value False to the variable D. Booleans are used to represent truth values (True or False).
	5.	E = None: The variable E is set to None, which is a special keyword in Python representing the absence of a value, often used to signify that a variable has no data assigned to it.
